## Hi there 👋

I’m a rising senior focusing on Game Development, AI, and Robotics. My passion lies in the artistic side of coding; bringing worlds to life, crafting immersive experiences, and exploring how gameplay, visuals, and interactivity blend into a powerful storytelling medium.

I have experience with Java, Python, and C, and I’m always looking for ways to push creative boundaries through code. Whether it’s designing intuitive mechanics, experimenting with visual effects, or shaping emotional player journeys, I see game development as both a technical craft and an art form.

I’m inspired by the magic that happens when creativity meets code, and I’m eager to collaborate with others who share that same spark for building meaningful, imaginative games.
