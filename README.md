## Hi there 👋

I’m a senior focusing on Game Development, AI, and Robotics. My passion lies in the artistic side of coding; bringing worlds to life, crafting immersive experiences, and exploring how gameplay, visuals, and interactivity blend into a powerful storytelling medium.

I work with Unity, Fusion, and Blender, combining 2D/3D art, character design, and environment creation with programming in Java, Python, and C. My goal is to blend creativity and technology to craft meaningful, visually rich, and emotionally engaging games.

I’m inspired by the magic that happens when creativity meets code, and I’m eager to collaborate with others who share that same spark for building meaningful, imaginative games.
